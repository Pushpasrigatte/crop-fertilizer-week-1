# CROP--FERTILIZER

# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

This repository contains a machine learning-based system for recommending suitable crops and fertilizers based on environmental and soil conditions. By leveraging datasets and predictive modeling, this project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions.

## Features
- Analyzes soil and environmental data.
- Recommends suitable crops for the given conditions.
- Suggests appropriate fertilizers to maximize yield.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the project:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (if used for ML modeling)

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset named `Crop_recommendation.csv`, which contains:
- Information about various crops.
- Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil nutrients.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/crop-recommendation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd crop-recommendation
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and recommendations:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook crop.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The system provides recommendations based on input conditions. Visualizations and results are included within the notebook.
